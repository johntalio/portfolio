Stethoscope is a web app and is currently a work in progress. Stethoscope uses the BetterDoctor API to access the professional, geographical, and biographical information of physicians from all over the country. This data is aggregated and can be searched and stored by users for their reference. The OpenFDA API is also used to make information about drugs readily accessible, and can similarly be searched and stored by users. The hope of this web app is to help make decisions about medical care easier for users while also presenting a catalogue of valuable information for those who need it.

The primary technologies used in this web app are Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, and CSS.
