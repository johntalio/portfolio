My most recent and proudest accomplishment is Truthy, a web application created as a final project for Dev Bootcamp. I collaborated on Truthy with three other talented wed developers and fellow DBC students: Supui "Tony" Lam, Jefferson Faseler, and Kevin Hu.

Truthy uses Machine Learning, IBM Watson Alchemy API, FullContact API, DatumBox API, and Aylien API to determine whether or not a news article is "truthy" or "falsey" - credible or not credible. Truthy delivers data essential to curious readers everywhere who want to know if they can trust the news they read. Truthy utilizes Ruby on Rails on the server side (backend) and primarily React as well as jQuery on the client side (frontend). HTML5, CSS, and Bootstrap are the tools we used to design the site, giving it a clean, polished look. Additionally, we took advantage of the excellent resources available in the D3.js library to create the bar chart and the bubble chart displayed on our site's data page - we felt that data visualization was a key component of providing our users with easily digestible information.
