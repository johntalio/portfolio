In 2014, I graduated from Fordham University with a Bachelor of Arts in English and International Political Economy. During my time at Fordham, I cultivated my love of creative pursuits such as writing, literature, theater, and film. I also enjoyed studying statistics, foreign policy, international affairs, and much more.

After college, I worked a few part time jobs and continued exploring new avenues of interests. After visiting Epic Systems' campus in Verona, WI and interning with Gartner in Stamford, CT, I began seriously considering a change in my professional life. It was not long after that I started researched coding bootcamps and found Dev Bootcamp (DBC).

DBC introduced me to coding and I was delighted by it: I love the challenge it poses, the curiosity it inspires, and the endless possibilities. I graduated from DBC in February 2017 and have been coding ever since.

While I am focusing primarily on coding right now, I still hold my other passions - reading, writing, learning about different cultures and places - dear to me. I am always interested in learning new things and exploring new spaces, and I am interested in finding out where coding takes me.
