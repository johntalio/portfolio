Gem-Mine is a web app created as a test assignment for Teachable. Gem-Mine uses the functionality of the Ruby gem 'gem' to allow users to search the Ruby gem database for any and all Ruby gems. Based on the user's input, Gem-Mine will return information regarding a particular gem as well as that gem's dependencies. Users can add and remove gems from their list of favorite gems as well.

The primary technologies used in this web app are Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, CSS, jQuery, and AJAX.
