In 2014 I graduated from Fordham University with a BA in English and International Political Economy, and while I excelled academically at Fordham, I found navigating the job market particularly difficult. After two years of working in dead-end, unfulfilling jobs, I decided to take a leap of faith and enroll in Dev Bootcamp (DBC) to further my education and gain a completely new skill set.

I graduated from DBC in February of 2017, and I can say with confidence that it changed my outlook on life. DBC rekindled my desire for growth and learning and lifted me out of the stagnant mire in which I found myself only 19 weeks prior. DBC introduced me to coding and I love it: I love the challenge it poses, the curiosity it inspires, and all that awaits.

While I am focusing primarily on coding right now, I still hold my other passions - reading, writing, learning about different cultures and places - dear to me. I am always interested in learning new things and exploring new spaces. I hope you enjoy my portfolio and please feel free to contact me!
